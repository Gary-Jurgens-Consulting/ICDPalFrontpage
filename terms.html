                    <p>Certain features require a paid subscription. Subscription fees are billed in advance and renew automatically unless cancelled prior to renewal.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.2 Usage Credits</h3>
                    <p>Some features consume usage-based credits (“Credits”). Credits may be included in a subscription or purchased separately. Credits have no cash value, are non-transferable, and may not be resold.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6.3 Refund Policy</h3>
                    <p>Subscription fees are non-refundable, including partial periods, unused time, or downgrades.</p>
                    <p>Unused purchased (stand-alone) credits may, at ICDPal’s sole discretion, be eligible for a refund provided that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The credits were purchased directly (not promotional or bundled),</li>

                        <li>The refund request is made within a reasonable time after purchase.</li>

                    <p>Cancellation prevents future renewals but does not entitle you to a refund for the current billing period.</p>
                    <p>Upon termination, unused promotional credits are forfeited. Purchased unused credits are governed by Section 6.3.</p>
